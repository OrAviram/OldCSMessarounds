I made this when I just started programming to learn C#.

This project has been with me for about 10 years now, but it's time to let go.

With time it became a complete mess, since every time I wanted to mess with something I put it here.

Eventually I also put it on BitBucket, there you can find my Vulkan messarounds, but it's kinda useless now.

The latest things here are the unfinished Nand2Tetris solution and, in the LearningCSharp project, a weird attempt at math stuff.

I probably won't ever return to this. I eventually want to redo Nand2Tetris since I still didn't finish the last two chapters,
but I'll use a new project. The one here stopped because I started it in high school, then took a break because of theater class being annoying,
and then just didn't return to it.

I have no idea what I was doing in the LearningCSharp project and I don't even want to know.
